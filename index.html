            <p>I have both academic and job experience using .NET, C#, and SQL. I have written code using Java and 
                    C#, and have developed applications ranging from web page development to reports that query 
                    databases.	My primary technical interest is to write and support original code in applications that solve 
                    customer/client problems. Positions that support this goal or help me achieve it are of interest to me.  
                    Further, I am passionate about delivering high quality work products to my employer to contribute to the 
                    success of the company.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since graduating with a B.S. degree Computer Science from UH-Victoria in 2015, I have worked as a junior 
                    software developer at Stupp Corporation, an oil services company that manufactures drilling pipes, and 
                    Huntington-Ingalls, one of the premier military ship builders in the world. Most recently, I have enrolled in 
                    the UT-Austin Center for Professional Education- Houston Coding Boot Camp. Upon completion in 
                    February 2019, I will have in-depth knowledge of a variety of coding languages and platforms, including 
                    those that support the activities of a full stack web developer. </p>
